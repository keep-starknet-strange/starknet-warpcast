# Find you starket friends on Farcaster!

The project implements a farcaster frame, which allows you to find starknet builders on warpcast!

## How does it work?
- It parses the list from [here](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/starknet-warpcast/blob/main/builder_follow_builder.md).
- Then uses [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to screenshot all profiles, by running a headless chrome in the background!
- Then randomly suggests starknet profiles!
